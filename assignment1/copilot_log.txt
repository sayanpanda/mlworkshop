# GitHub Copilot Interaction Log

## Session: Galaxy Rotation Curve Simulation
Date: May 30, 2025

### Initial Request
User: "#fetch_webpage https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html use the astropy.units throught the code for unit handling. Go through the TASK.md file"
Action: 
- Fetched astropy.units documentation
- Created Jupyter notebook for galaxy rotation curve simulation
- Implemented initial code structure with proper unit handling

### Follow-up Interaction
User: "yes do create the readme.md file. the disk part of the galaxy rotation curve looks wrong, redo it"
Actions:
- Fixed disk rotation curve calculation using correct Bessel function implementation
- Created comprehensive README.md file explaining approach
- Updated documentation and implementation details

### Technical Documentation
1. Created galaxy_rotation_curve.ipynb with:
   - Proper imports (numpy, matplotlib, astropy.units, scipy.special)
   - Parameter definitions for Milky Way-like galaxy
   - Fixed disk component calculation
   - NFW halo component implementation
   - Total rotation curve calculation
   - Visualization with matplotlib

2. Created README.md with:
   - Problem-solving approach
   - Implementation details
   - Technical considerations
   - Requirements and results

Each implementation step followed PEP-8 guidelines and included proper unit handling via astropy.units throughout the calculations.
