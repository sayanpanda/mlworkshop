# Simulate a Galaxy Rotation Curve
* Use Python 3.12
* Enforce PEP-8
* Document all the function and classes following NumPy standard

* Create a README.md file detailing the problem solving approach.


* Model the galaxy rotation curve of spiral galaxy using a combination of disk and spherical halo component.
* Use representative parameters for a Milky-way like galaxy.
* plot the total rotation curve along with individual disk and halo contribution over 0-30 kiloparsec.
* use astropy.units to handle the units throughout.
* Use matplotlib for plotting purspose.
* save the plots in the working directory.
